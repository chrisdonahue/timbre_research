graph.hpp:
	pretty much everything

interpolate_linear.hpp
	change name to linear.hpp
	consider interface (using in realtime/adding points)
	create increments at prepare time

everything:
	transfer extra hpp stuff to cpp
	create parameter/ folder
	move everything to src/ folder
	create README.md
	create Makefile to compile it as a library for static linking
	create TODO in cdsp
	move primitives_base to cdsp/... oscillators_base to primitives/... etc;

tables:
	hard clip input for table_function

questions:
	figure out using for constructors
	initialization list used by all constructors?
	shared_ptr for shared tables? (table_interpolate_4)
	references instead of pointers for parameter_plugs in primitive_base.hpp?
	list of times for value_next_set (so we can set value at a time rather than one at a time)
