graph.hpp:
	pretty much everything
	
helpers.hpp
	inverse_memoized change to inverse with better type signature
	find all references and remove IF CDSP_HIGH_MEM stuff

adsr.hpp:
	think about API for release and reset (maybe release at a certain time like line 16... look at javascript AudioParameter again)
	
questions:
	figure out using for constructors
	initialization list used by all constructors?
	shared_ptr for shared tables? (table_interpolate_4)
	references instead of pointers for parameter_plugs in primitive_base.hpp?
	list of times for value_next_set (so we can set value at a time rather than one at a time)
